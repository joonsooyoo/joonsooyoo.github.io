We propose a privacy-preserving biometric authentication framework leveraging TFHE-based transciphering. Our approach reduces ciphertext expansion and key overhead by introducing a trusted party and a novel encryption flow, enabling fast encrypted-domain authentication suitable for real-world deployment.
